## Aims
	- This application aims to show the use of the S3DK LabVIEW API (PRL) and the functionalities in the associated LabVIEW pallete of functions used to develop a simple display tool.

	- It allows to quickly deploy a synchrophasor display in any computer to PMU data without the need of proprietary software or licenses. To use the application as it is, the user must configure the connection settings to a Phasor Measurement Unit or Phasor Data Concentrator as indicated in the Quick Start Guide of the S3DK ([link]()).

	- Developers can quickly adapt it to develop dedicated displays or as a starting point to learn how to develop other applications using the S3DK and LabVIEW.
